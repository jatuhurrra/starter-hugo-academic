I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://nlp.naist.jp/en/">Natural Language Processing Lab</a> of NAIST, working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tarowtnb/">Prof. Taro Watanabe</a>. [I'm grateful for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hidetakakamigaito">Hidetaka Kamigaito</a>, <a href="https://hshindo.com/">Hiroyuki Shindo</a>, and <a href="https://hiroki13.github.io/">Hiroki Ouchi</a> guidance too.]

My NLP research interests lie in information extraction, evaluation of NLP models, multilingualism and low-resource NLP. Broadly speaking, I am passionate about applying deep learning approaches to enable machines to understand human language, and facilitate communication between humans and social robots.

I am also affiliated with <a href="http://www.jp.honda-ri.com/en/">HONDA Research Institute Japan (HRI-JP)</a> as a Part-time Researcher, and my work is primarily focused on <b>Intent Recognition in Language</b> for a Social Robot. I collaborate with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=I3_MfAMAAAAJ&hl=en">Eric Nichols</a> (and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antondelafuente/">Anton de la Fuente</a>, previously).

Previously, I worked on <b>Intrusion Detection</b> in IoT networks in the <a href="http://www-lsm.naist.jp/en/">Large-scale Systems Management Lab</a> of <a href="http://www.naist.jp/en/">NAIST</a> during my master's degree where <a href="http://www-lsm.naist.jp/~kasahara/index-e.html"> Prof. Shoji Kasahara</a> advised me.

I spent time as a Research Student at <a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en"> Kyoto University</a>, in <a href="https://www.db.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/doku.php/en:start"> Yoshikawa Lab </a> in the <a href="https://www.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/"> Graduate School of Informatics </a>. While there, I was supervised and mentored by <a href="https://www.db.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yoshikawa/index-en.html"> Prof. Masatoshi Yoshikawa </a> on several methods mainly related to Information Retrieval, Databases, Human-Computer Interface design and Artificial Intelligence.

My graduate studies are fully funded by the Japanese government's <a href="https://www.mext.go.jp/en/policy/education/highered/title02/detail02/sdetail02/1373897.htm">MEXT</a> scholarship for which I am incredibly grateful.

<!-- At the same time, I'm working on a few projects in NLP namely; <b>Syllable Tokenization</b> and <b>Corpus Building</b> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tarowtnb/">Prof. Taro Watanabe</a> and <a href="https://hshindo.com/">Asst. Prof. Hiroyuki Shindo</a> from the <a href="https://nlp.naist.jp/en/">Natural Language Processing Lab</a> at NAIST. -->
